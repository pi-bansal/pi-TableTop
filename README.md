# pi-TableTop
The development of Interactive TableTop- A TUIO interaction based multi-touch table.
Aims at building the tabletop using Raspberry Pi.
Different technologies are being tried and tested.
There are two kinds of applications required, both of which should run on Raspberry Pi:
  1. Tracking application: reacTIVision was initially used but it has some installation issues. 
                              Also, compilation required some libraries which are either depracated or non existent for Pi/ armhf arch.
  2. Client application: Kivy was used but not flexible to code with window parameters and flow control.
                          
 Reasearch is going on in this area.
